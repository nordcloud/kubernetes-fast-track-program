# https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file

# Before the docker CLI sends the context to the docker daemon,
# it looks for a file named .dockerignore in the root directory of the context.
# If this file exists, the CLI modifies the context to exclude files and
# directories that match patterns in it. This helps to avoid unnecessarily
# sending large or sensitive files and directories to the daemon and potentially
# adding them to images using ADD or COPY.
